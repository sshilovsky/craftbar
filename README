CraftBar
~~~~~~~~

This is a proof-of-concept attempt to implement Blizzard(R)'s *Craft-like
digit bindings for X11 windows.

Ctrl+[0-9] binds a window to a digit.

Alt+[0-9] switches to a previously bound window.

You can easyly modify default bindings in cfg.h which is as large as 3
significant lines of code.

BUGS
~~~~
* desktop switching to the bound window is not implemented for i3-wm and other
  non-ewmh-compliant managers.
