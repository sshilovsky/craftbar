CraftBar
~~~~~~~~

This is a proof-of-concept attempt to implement Blizzard(R)'s *Craft-like
digit bindings for X11 windows.

Ctrl+[0-9] binds a window to a digit.

Alt+[0-9] switches to a previously bound window.

You can easyly modify default bindings in cfg.h which is as large as 3
significant lines of code.

BUGS
~~~~
* desktop switching to the bound window is not implemented for i3-wm and other
  non-ewmh-compliant managers.
* the task bar itself behaves really strange.

This piece of code was started from fspanel which happend to be really small
but turned to have been dead since about 2000 A.D. So please don't blame me for
buttons jumping or icons not showing :)


Original fspanel README follows:

F***ing Small Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is it and what can it do?

It's a panel for Linux that lists all your windows, but the difference
is that it's tiny. The binary is about 10k and it takes barely any
memory. It works under any gnome compliant window manager (eg. E, SawFish,
WindowMaker, IceWM) and supports KDE's mini icons (the KWM_WIN_ICON atom).

See http://www.chatjunkies.org/fspanel/ for more information.

Changes in 0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Windows that set their icons after mapping no longer get the
  generic icon.
* A new generic icon (looks better, I think).
* Fixed lockup when large amount of windows are open.
* Desktop switching arrows look different.
* Panel height and width are customizable at the top of fspanel.c.
  Made the default 24 (previously 22) and font 12. This seems to
  suite 1024x768 well, change to what suites you.
* Now uses the unified window manager spec to find the list of
  windows. Falls back to gnome spec if unavailable. This might make
  fspanel work on KDE? Note: this is only partially supported and
  uses the unified spec only for a client list, everything else
  still uses the gnome window manager spec.
* Optimized more code - i386-linux binary is now 9280 bytes!

Changes in 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The clock now updates on-the-minute.
* Optimized some code - binary is 300 bytes smaller :)
* Made it possible to compile without libXpm.
* Included some Makefiles for FreeBSD and Solaris.
* No crash when display fails to open.

Changes in 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fix refresh for XFree86 4.
* Fix switching desktops (works in Sawfish now too).
* Make windows focus when raising.
